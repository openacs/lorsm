# In order to share courses across classes, we need to share
# file-storage objects across file-storage instances. This has been
# proven to be really tricky. But here we pass the fs_package_id for
# the current community, so we don't have to have permissions for
# other instances of file-storages of other classes.  See
# documentation for further details.
